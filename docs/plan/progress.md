# Slice Progress

## Slice 0: Source Integration Spike

- Files changed: `docs/plan/integration-feasibility.md`, `docs/plan/fragility-register.md`,
  `docs/plan/progress.md`
- Verification: temporary scratch crate compiled and ran against adjacent `../jj/cli` and
  `../jj/lib`; compared `jj log` default output, ASCII graph style, and a custom log template;
  `just md-check`
- Remaining risk: `jj_cli` rendering pieces are public, but end-to-end workspace and command setup
  still requires awkward external wiring or copied orchestration
- Next slice: Slice 1: Log Row Contract, using the narrowed subprocess-plus-metadata path

## Slice 1: Log Row Contract

- Files changed: `src/jj.rs`, `src/graph.rs`, `docs/plan/progress.md`
- Verification: focused `cargo test restore_selection`,
  `cargo test converts_ansi_output_to_selectable_items`, full `cargo test`, and
  `rustup run nightly cargo fmt`
- Remaining risk: refresh preservation is keyed only by change id, so rows without a parsed change
  id still fall back to index clamping by design
- Next slice: Slice 2: View Mode Infrastructure

## Slice 2: View Mode Infrastructure

- Files changed: `src/app.rs`, `src/command.rs`, `src/diff.rs`, `src/graph.rs`, `src/jj.rs`,
  `src/show.rs`, `src/tui.rs`, `src/view_state.rs`, `docs/plan/progress.md`
- Verification: full `cargo test` before and after `rustup run nightly cargo fmt`, then
  `just md-check`
- Remaining risk: custom revset entry now exists through a lightweight graph-only prompt (`W`), but
  it does not yet offer history, editing helpers, or generated help text
- Next slice: Slice 3: Generated Help and Keymap

## Slice 3: Generated Help And Keymap

- Files changed: `src/app.rs`, `src/command.rs`, `src/tui.rs`, `src/view_state.rs`,
  `docs/plan/progress.md`
- Verification: full `cargo test` before and after `rustup run nightly cargo fmt`, including new
  help-projection and snapshot-style overlay tests, then `just md-check`
- Remaining risk: the status bar still uses concise handwritten hint text, while the help overlay is
  now the generated source of truth for exact bindings
- Next slice: Slice 4: Direct `jj git fetch`

## Slice 4: Direct `jj git fetch`

- Files changed: `src/app.rs`, `src/command.rs`, `src/jj.rs`, `src/tui.rs`, `docs/plan/progress.md`
- Verification: full `cargo test` before and after `rustup run nightly cargo fmt`; disposable-repo
  manual `jj --no-pager git fetch` run with signing disabled in the temporary Git repo;
  `just   md-check`
- Remaining risk: fetch output is summarized into the one-line status area rather than preserved in
  a dedicated output view, so unusually verbose fetch output may be harder to inspect
- Next slice: Slice 5: Direct `jj new trunk`

## Slice 5: Direct `jj new trunk`

- Files changed: `src/app.rs`, `src/command.rs`, `src/diff.rs`, `src/graph.rs`, `src/jj.rs`,
  `src/show.rs`, `src/tui.rs`, `src/view_state.rs`, `docs/plan/progress.md`
- Verification: full `cargo test`, then review-driven follow-up tests for the graph visibility
  fallback, another full `cargo test`, `rustup run nightly cargo fmt`, disposable-repo manual
  `jj --no-pager new 'trunk()'` run after cloning a temporary remote with a configured `main`
  branch, and `just md-check`
- Remaining risk: the exact-target validation and mode fallback are covered by helper tests and
  manual proof, but not yet by an app-level mocked command-runner test around the whole direct
  action path
- Next slice: Slice 6: Status Screen First Pass

## Slice 6: Status Screen First Pass

- Files changed: `src/app.rs`, `src/command.rs`, `src/jj.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/status.rs`,
  `src/tui.rs`, `src/view_state.rs`, `docs/plan/implementation-slices.md`,
  `docs/plan/screens/status.md`, `docs/plan/progress.md`
- Verification: focused `cargo test status::`, `cargo test parses_status_startup_view`, and
  `cargo test help_overlay_text_renders_generated_sections`; full `cargo test`;
  `rustup run nightly cargo fmt`; `markdownlint-cli2 docs/plan/progress.md`
- Remaining risk: the native status screen now has a dedicated shortcut and direct `jk status`
  startup path, but command-mode entry remains deferred because that app surface is not yet present,
  and recommended planning keeps command mode secondary
- Next slice: Slice 7: Operation Log First Pass
