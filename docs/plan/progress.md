# Slice Progress

## Slice 0: Source Integration Spike

- Files changed: `docs/plan/integration-feasibility.md`, `docs/plan/fragility-register.md`,
  `docs/plan/progress.md`
- Verification: temporary scratch crate compiled and ran against adjacent `../jj/cli` and
  `../jj/lib`; compared `jj log` default output, ASCII graph style, and a custom log template;
  `just md-check`
- Remaining risk: `jj_cli` rendering pieces are public, but end-to-end workspace and command setup
  still requires awkward external wiring or copied orchestration
- Next slice: Slice 1: Log Row Contract, using the narrowed subprocess-plus-metadata path

## Slice 1: Log Row Contract

- Files changed: `src/jj.rs`, `src/graph.rs`, `docs/plan/progress.md`
- Verification: focused `cargo test restore_selection`,
  `cargo test converts_ansi_output_to_selectable_items`, full `cargo test`, and
  `rustup run nightly cargo fmt`
- Remaining risk: refresh preservation is keyed only by change id, so rows without a parsed change
  id still fall back to index clamping by design
- Next slice: Slice 2: View Mode Infrastructure
