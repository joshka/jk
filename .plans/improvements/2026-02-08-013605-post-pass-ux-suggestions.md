# Post-Pass UX Suggestions (For Next Confirmation Cycle)

## Context

This file captures follow-up ideas after completing the current grouped-help and header cleanup
batch. Items are intentionally unapproved until explicitly confirmed.

## Status Key

- `considered`: captured and discussed, not yet accepted for current pass
- `accepted`: approved for implementation in next pass
- `rejected`: intentionally not doing
- `done`: implemented and validated

## Candidate Next Batch

1. `considered` - Add `Navigation History` mini-section in help with concrete back/forward examples
   (`Left/Right`, `Ctrl+o/i`) and expected behavior.
1. `considered` - Add `minimal hints` toggle to reduce footer verbosity for power users.
1. `considered` - Add `:help <workflow>` presets (`inspect`, `rewrite`, `sync`, `recover`) that
   filter help content to one intent.
1. `considered` - Add `first-time hints` mode that auto-hides after first successful use of a flow.
1. `considered` - Add screenshot captions in README that call out the exact user decision each
   screen supports.
1. `considered` - Add dedicated snapshots for header/footer chrome to prevent future regressions in
   duplication and hint density.

## Next Decision Gate

Confirm which items should move to `accepted` for the next implementation batch.
